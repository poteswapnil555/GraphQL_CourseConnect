## ðŸ“Œ GraphQL Overview

The backend uses GraphQL for efficient data communication. Clients request only the data they need using queries and mutations. The schema includes:
- `User`
- `Instructor`
- `Course`

Example query:
```graphql
query {
  courses {
    title
    instructor {
      name
    }
  }
}
